# Clock App Readme

This project is a simple clock application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides both a digital and an analog representation of the current time, along with the current date. Additionally, it includes a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.

## Features

- **Digital Clock:** The application displays the current time in a digital format, including hours, minutes, and AM/PM indication.

- **Date Display:** The date is presented in a user-friendly format, showing the day of the week, month, and day of the month.

- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** Users can switch between dark and light modes by clicking the toggle button. This feature enhances user experience and accommodates different preferences.
